# Tuva Streamlit Template App

This is a ready-to-run **Streamlit app template** for analyzing healthcare claims data using the Tuva data model and Snowflake. It demonstrates best practices for structuring multipage apps, using shared helper functions, and working with Snowflake credentials securely.

---

## 📋 What This Template Includes

- ✅ **Multipage Streamlit layout** with pages in the `pages/` folder
- ✅ **Snowflake integration** using `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- ✅ **Reusable code** via `shared/utils/helpers.py`
- ✅ **Visualizations** using Plotly and pandas
- ✅ **Custom styling** via Streamlit’s `markdown()` injection

## 🚀 How to Run This App

1. **Navigate to this app’s folder**:

   ```bash
   cd streamlit_apps/tuva_template
   ```

2. **Set up Snowflake credentials** by creating a file:

   ```
   .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

   Example contents:

   ```toml
   [snowflake]
   user = "your_username"
   account = "your_account"
   warehouse = "your_warehouse"
   database = "your_database"
   schema = "your_schema"
   authenticator = "externalbrowser"
   ```

3. **Ensure that the virtual environment is activated**

   Once activated, you should see the venv name in your terminal prompt like:

   ```bash
   (venv) $
   ```

   If you don't see this, it likely means the environment is not activated.
   To activate it, follow the instructions in the README.md file located in the root folder, or use one of the following commands based on your OS:

   #### 💻 macOS/Linux
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

   #### 🪟 Windows
      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 🛠 Developer Notes

- `helpers.get_table_data()` is the default function for querying Snowflake and returning a DataFrame. It lives in `shared/utils/helpers.py`.
- Any imports from `shared/` require that you first add the project root to `sys.path`. This is handled at the top of each page using `path_utils.add_repo_to_path(levels_up=3)`.
- The `dashboard.py` and `claim_amount.py` pages each demonstrate different types of visualizations using claims data.
